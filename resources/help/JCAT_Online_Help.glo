NAME=Application Menu
A menu located along the top of the of the JCAT window which is used to achieve functionality within JCAT.
NAME=Application Window
The Application Window is where a user can find a variety of windows, toolbars, and menus necessary to build a plan.
NAME=Bayesian Networks
Bayesian networks are based on a  mathematical probability theorythat allows us to model uncertainty about the world and outcomes of interest by combiningcommon-sense knowledge and observational evidence.
NAME=Delay
Delay determines how long after a signal or Scheduling is received by the Event or Mechanism that the Event or Mechanism will react
NAME=Event
Something that occurs in the real world that is also of importance to the situational model simulated by JCAT.
NAME=Evidence Manager
This feature is used to introduce information from a detection or deduction into the model.
NAME=File Toolbar
The File Toolbar provides the user with functions needed to create a new plan, open a plan, close a plan, save a plan, paste documents, and display help documentation.
NAME=Mechanism
Mechanisms are explanations of the causal relationship between two Events.
NAME=Navigation Tree
This dialog is an additional method for accessing the properties of Events and Mechanisms.
NAME=Plan Context Menu
A menu available to the modeler to perform various operations throughout the modeling process.
NAME=Plan Toolbar
This toolbar provides users with the tools necessary to build a model.
NAME=Plotting
Plotting is used In JCAT to observe how an Event behaves over time.  In this case time can be represented by minutes, hours, days and so forth.
NAME=Probability Profiles
This feature is used to display the graphs for plotted Events and Mechanisms.
NAME=Profile Legend
The Profile Legend displays the Events and Mechanisms that are plotted on the ProbabilityProfiles graph.
NAME=Property Viewer
The Property Viewer displays the values for an Event’s or Mechanism’s various fields.
NAME=Resources
This function is used to maintain counts of resource usage.
NAME=Sampler
The Sampler is used to determine the probability of the different Events based on their Scheduling, Evidence, and any signals they receive or send.
NAME=Timing Dialog
This dialog is used to modify the  temporal progression of a plan.
