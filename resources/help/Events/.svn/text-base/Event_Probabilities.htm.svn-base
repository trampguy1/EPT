<p class="hcp2">Specifying probabilities in the Event Editor 
 Dialog is how we modify the effect that incoming signals have on an Event. 
 &nbsp;Signals 
 are sent between Events through Mechanisms and change the probability 
 that an Event occurs. &nbsp;There 
 are two types of signals that an Event can receive: Causal and Inhibiting. 
 &nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">A Causal signal increases the probability 
 that the event will occur, and an Inhibiting signal decreases the probability 
 that the event will occur. &nbsp;A 
 specified signal probability determines how much the presence of the signal 
 increases or decreases the probability of the Event occurring. &nbsp;For 
 instance, if an Event receives a Causal signal with a specified probability 
 of 0.75, then when the signal is present, the Event is 75% more likely 
 to occur. &nbsp;If 
 an Event receives an Inhibiting signal with a specified probability of 
 0.8, then when the signal is present, the Event is 80% less likely to 
 occur.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">To modify these specified probabilities 
 for an Event, select the “Specified Probabilities” pane in the Event Editor 
 dialog.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">To modify an individual signal’s probability, 
 enter the desired probability in the associated row in the “<a title="Click here to view where to set alone probability" href="Alone_Prob_Column.htm" class="hcp3">alone</a>” column. &nbsp;This 
 will be the quantity by which the Event’s probability will be affected 
 if the signal is present. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Sometimes, Events occur differently when 
 a specific group of signals is present. &nbsp;For 
 instance, for an army to be successful, it needs both weapons and soldiers. 
 If an army has only men or only weapons, it is not likely to succeed. 
 &nbsp;If the 
 army has both, then it is much more likely to be successful. &nbsp;Thus, 
 the probability that the army will be successful given that it has both 
 soldiers and weapons is greater than the sum of the individual probabilities 
 for just soldiers alone and weapons alone.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">With this reasoning, groups of signals 
 can be put together so that a specific probability can be assigned for 
 that group. &nbsp;To 
 add a new group, click on the New Group button <img src="../image22.gif" 
 width="80" height="20" border="0"> . &nbsp;Then 
 select the signals to include in the group. &nbsp;</p>
