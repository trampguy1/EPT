<p class="hcp2">At this point, if we rerun the sampler 
 by clicking the Start Sampler &nbsp;&nbsp;Button 
 and plot the probability graph for “Missing person report”, we will see 
 a graph very similar to the plot of “Commit murder”, only translated over 
 5 timesteps and with a slightly smaller probabilities. &nbsp;How 
 can we use this to gain extra insight into our model?</p>
<p class="hcp2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Suppose we have evidence that Salvatore’s 
 wife did, in fact, file such a report at time 10. &nbsp;How 
 does this change our beliefs about the murder? &nbsp;Right 
 click on “Missing person report” and select Evidence from the popup menu. 
 &nbsp;The Evidence 
 dialog should appear. &nbsp;Go 
 to the “Absolute Evidence” tab and enter in 10 in the field that is labeled 
 “Time” and enter 0.9 in the field labeled “Probability.” &nbsp;Click 
 “Add Belief” to add this to the evidence list. &nbsp;This 
 means that we are 90% certain that the report was filed.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Now, rerun the sampler and plot “Commit 
 murder.” &nbsp;You 
 will see that the solid plot will not have changed, but there will be 
 a dotted line plot that will be different from the solid. &nbsp;This 
 is the probability plot that takes evidence into account, and you should 
 notice that when we take this evidence into account, the probability that 
 Tony commits murder at time 5 goes up. &nbsp;This 
 shows that the later evidence reinforces the prediction that the murder 
 is likely to happen at that time.</p>
