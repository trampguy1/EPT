 Uncertainty in Models</td></tr>

<p class="hcp2">Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has 
 developed a true Bayesian tool for managing uncertainty in temporal Models. 
 The tool is principled, rich in supported modeling details, and feasible 
 both for humans to use and for PCs to compute.<br>
<br>
<span class="hcp3">During conflict, risk is continuous 
 concern for commanders. A major source of risk is uncertainty about future 
 outcomes of their presently Modelned and executing actions. Another source 
 of uncertainty, is understanding how the outcomes commanders do see relate 
 to actions they previously took or were taken by others, including the 
 adversary. The US Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate 
 (AFRL/IF) Rome Research Site is developing a technology to address each 
 of these problems.<br>
<br>
Temporal Models are Models which evolve over time. Such Models present 
 Bayesian analysis with many challenges, both humanistic and computational. 
 &nbsp;True Bayesian 
 analysis, with its voracious appetite for numbers, can overwhelm both 
 analyst and computer. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Current Baysean tools, in order to tame this appetite, often resort to 
 extreme approximations. These approximations render the potential power 
 of Bayesian analysis almost ineffective, and result in analysis little 
 different from Fuzzy Sets or heuristics. The result is that Models are 
 modeled and analyzed with limited, often almost useless levels of fidelity.<br>
<br>
The AFRL tool avoids extreme approximation not justified by the domain. 
 By allowing the analyst to provide exactly and only those numbers she 
 thinks important and by estimating all others through model based causal 
 (as opposed to statistical) reasoning the tool spares the human from being 
 overwhelmed. By avoiding computation of non-essential results, the computer 
 can avoid being overwhelmed. The result is a tool which does not need 
 to assume away the power of true Bayesian analysis and therefore can provide 
 semantically meaningful results. <br>
<br>
</span><span class="hcp4"><B>The Problem<br>
<br>
</B></span><span class="hcp3">The temporal aspects of Models 
 arise from three major sources. First the actions under the control of 
 the Modeler are scheduled over period of time, not necessarily all taking 
 place at once. Second, there are often delays in the effects produced 
 by these scheduled actions, and, third, the direct and indirect effects 
 which are produced may last for only finite period of time. The uncertainties 
 in these Models arise because the scheduled actions will not always produce 
 the desired effects, length of delays may vary as may periods of persistence. 
 Moreover, multiple causes acting in temporal relation with each other 
 may be required to produce some effects.<br>
<br>
Large uncertain temporal Models are notoriously difficult for humans to 
 accurately understand. Local cause/effect uncertainties seem to be significantly 
 easier to understand and estimate than are the uncertainties of indirect 
 effects propagated across a Model from many local sources. For example, 
 if a bomb of a certain kind strikes a particular type of bridge, the probability 
 that the bridge will be unusable after the strike is understandable and 
 can be determined, at least in principle, by empirical testing. Suppose, 
 however, that the purpose of bombing the bridge is not simply to disrupt 
 road transportation but also to disrupt the electrical power transmitted 
 on cables carried by the bridge. Suppose further, that these effects are 
 desired for their indirect effects on both food supply and morale. It 
 is hoped that these in turn will cause civil unrest. In any reasonable 
 Model it is likely that many other actions will also be taken with the 
 ultimate goal of achieving civil unrest. In such a case it becomes much 
 more difficult for humans to assess the overall effect of successfully 
 (or not) having destroyed a particular bridge.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the AFRL tool is to integrate and to propagate local probabilistic 
 assessment of Model elements into an overall assessment of global Model 
 uncertainty. The primary output of the tool is the probability over time 
 that particular effects will be achieved. (See Figure 2a.) This propagation 
 is carried out in a principled way using models of the (uncertain) cause/effect 
 relationships forming the basis of a Model. It is the principled, genuinely 
 Bayesian, methods that differentiates the AFRL tool from its competitors. 
 Because of its principled methods and lack of unrealistic assumptions, 
 the results have clear meaning which can be understood, analyzed and debated.<br>
<br>
The uncertain analysis is done on causal models built by Modeling domain 
 experts. The local probabilities associated with elements of the Model 
 (e.g. the probability of closing a bridge as the result of an air attack) 
 are also provided to the tool. While some potential users balk at the 
 idea of providing probabilities, one of the main benefits of the tool’s 
 principled approach is how it facilitates user provision of probabilities.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="hcp4"><B>The Tool<br>
<br>
</B></span><span class="hcp3">How does the AFRL tool differ 
 from other superficially similar tools? With our tool, the modeler constructs 
 a model graphically, as in many other tools. Like other tools the modeler 
 provides numbers related to the uncertainty of the various cause/effect 
 relations. All tools then perform computations to provide an overall assessment 
 of uncertainty.<br>
<br>
But here the similarities end. Once the AFRL tool’s hood is raised, the 
 differences from other tools are as notable as the differences between 
 a NASCAR machine and its look-alike production model: <br>
<br>
1) The model is temporal not static: events can begin and end over time; 
 effects can be delayed; effects, once achieved, may have only finite persistence. 
 2) The edges strictly mean “causes,” not “is conditionally dependent on,” 
 “influences,” or some other, non-causal, perhaps ill-defined, &nbsp;meaning,. 
 &nbsp;Nodes in 
 the graph (causes) can have relations to each other besides “independent.” 
 Causes can be, for example, synergistic or jointly necessary. ‘AND’ relations 
 among causes can be modeled. Such relationships allow the user to build 
 higher fidelity models. 3) Causal relationships can also reduce (see below) 
 the number of probability estimates the user need provide. 4) Observations 
 of actual events can be used, over time, to update predictive results. 
 5) Large models with many temporal connections spanning significant time 
 lengths are computationally feasible. <br>
<br>
Yet with all these features, the meaning of the model and of the calculated 
 probabilities remains unchanged. To those familiar with modeling uncertainty, 
 these are large claims, and require a closer look. <br>
<br>
In the JCAT model below, an unpaid debt provides the motive for murder, 
 and a private confrontation provides the opportunity. For a particular 
 individual, whom we will call Tony, the table labeled “Probabilities of 
 ‘Murder’” provides the probabilities that the causes, both motive and 
 opportunity, will actually result in murder. Opportunity alone provides 
 only 1 in 100 chance. Motive alone, without a good opportunity, gives 
 a 30% chance. But both together make murder almost a certainty (.9 probability). 
 &nbsp;So far, 
 this is essentially a static model. <br>
<br>
<a href="Overview2.htm" id="a1" class="hcp5">Figure 1: a) Causal Model</a>; 
 <a href="Overview3.htm" class="hcp5">b) Uncertainty of Mechanisms 
 for Causing Murder</a><br>
<br>
The model becomes temporal by adding delays, start times, and persistence 
 to model events. Such values are not illustrated here, but their effects 
 are apparent in the graphs below: <br>
<br>
<a href="Overview4.htm" class="hcp5">Figure &nbsp;2: 
 a) Correlated Cause</a>; <a href="Overview6.htm" class="hcp5">b) 
 Independent Causes</a><br>
<br>
The blue line in Example 1.a shows that we expect a bad debt to almost 
 certainly occur (probability .9, vertical axis) at time 0 (horizontal 
 axis) and persist for four weeks. During the third week, as shown by the 
 gold line, we are expecting Tony to have an opportunity to “do something” 
 about the debt. So, based on our model of Tony, we think there is some 
 probability that a murder will occur during the first three weeks, but 
 is quite likely during the third week. However, once the debt is paid, 
 &nbsp;murder 
 probability drops almost to zero.<br>
<br>
Most existing Bayesian tools, including some popular in DoD, cannot model 
 probabilities over time as in the example above, nor can they model the 
 interaction between separate causes such as motive and opportunity. In 
 one popular tool, (if it could do temporal prediction), it &nbsp;would 
 probably produce a murder prediction such as the green line in Example 
 1b. It would look like this because the tool can only deal with probabilities 
 associated with individual causes, not interacting groups of causes. To 
 predict differently with this tool, it is probably necessary to assert 
 that Tony has a relatively high likelihood of committing murder, given 
 opportunity alone but no motive.<br>
<br>
Because the mathematics underlying JCAT preserve the probabilistic semantics 
 of the input, we are justified in claiming that the probability of murder 
 in the third week is 70%. If, like some tools, the probabilistic interpretation 
 of computations was not preserved, we might be able to say no more than 
 that there are more influences indicating murder in the third week. JCAT 
 offers users a clear definition of the parameters that they are estimating. 
 The value, .90, shown in Figure 1(b) means exactly that we expect: that 
 with 90% probability, if Tony has both motive and opportunity, he will 
 murder. All parameters entered into JCAT can be the product of such small 
 gedanken experiments.<br>
<br>
JCAT provides superior prediction and inference because it provides more 
 accurate probabilistic models of domains. Bayes’ rule is only as good 
 as the probabilistic models to which it applies. So Bayes’rule is never 
 more powerful than when applied within the context of JCAT.</span></p>
