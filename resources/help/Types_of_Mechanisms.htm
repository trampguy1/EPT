<h1>Types of Mechanisms</h1>

<p class="hcp1">In the Causal Analysis Tool, a mechanism 
 can represent a cause, an effect, or an inhibitor. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp2">A cause is that which 
 brings about an effect or a result. &nbsp;It 
 can be a reason for an action or condition (in other words, a motive). 
 &nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp2">An effect is that which 
 inevitably follows an antecedent (as a cause or agent). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp2">An inhibitor is that 
 which slows, interferes, or prohibits an action from occurring. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp1">CAT mechanisms are denoted as arcs culminating 
 with an arrowhead. &nbsp;</p>
