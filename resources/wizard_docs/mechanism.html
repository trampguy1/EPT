<b><font color="blue">Mechanism</font></b> <p>
A mechanism explains the causal relationship between an action and the result of an action. It applies for both direct linkages and indirect linkages.  JCat uses two main types of mechanisms:  <b>Causes </b> and <b> Inhibitors</b>.  These items are represented by lines with and arrow on one end.<p>
· A <b>cause</b> is that which brings about an effect or a result. It can be a reason for an action or condition (in other words, a motive). <br>
· An <b>inhibitor</b> is that which slows, interferes, or prohibits an action from occurring. <br>

<p>
Example <p>

The following are <b> mechanisms </b>: <br>
 - bridge unusable <br>
 - enemy intimidated by invasion <br>
